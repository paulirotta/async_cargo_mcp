**Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Cargo with asynchronous response handling and comprehensive operation monitoring.**

This project provides a high performance MCP server that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with Rust's Cargo build system operations asynchronously. This allows the LLM to proceed on other tasks with the async_cargo_mcp process as an concurrent agent. It supports real-time progress updates, operation cancellation, timeout handling, and extensible command architecture.

## Features

### Core Cargo Integration
- **Complete Cargo Command Support**: build, test, add, remove, check, update, run
- **Working Directory Support**: All commands accept optional `working_directory` parameter for safe project isolation
- **Real Command Execution**: Uses actual `cargo` subprocess calls with proper error handling
- **Parameter Validation**: Type-safe parameter structures with JSON schema validation

### Asynchronous Operation Support
- **Optional Async Notifications**: Enable via `enable_async_notifications` parameter for start/completion events
- **Non-blocking Execution**: LLMs can continue processing while cargo operations run in background
- **Real-time Progress Updates**: Stream operation status and timing information
- **Callback System**: Pluggable callback architecture (NoOp, Logging, Channel-based)

### Operation Monitoring & Management
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Monitor operation lifecycle from pending â†’ running â†’ completed/failed/cancelled/timed out
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts with automatic cancellation of long-running operations
- **Operation Statistics**: Success/failure rates, average duration, detailed metrics
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Background task removes old completed operations
- **Cancellation Support**: Cancel running operations with proper cleanup

### Extensible Architecture
- **Dynamic Command Registry**: Auto-discover available cargo subcommands
- **Trait-based Commands**: Easy extension with `CargoCommand` trait
- **Plugin System**: Register custom cargo command implementations
- **Schema Generation**: Automatic JSON schema for command parameters

### Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 23+ tests covering all functionality
- **Detailed Logging**: Structured logging with operation tracing
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with descriptive messages
- **Type Safety**: Full Rust type safety with serde serialization

## Status

### Current Capabilities
- âœ… Working directory support for safe testing
- âœ… MCP protocol integration with JSON schema validation
- âœ… Basic cargo command execution (build, test, add, remove, doc, check, update)
- âœ… Async callback notifications for progress tracking
- âœ… Operation monitoring with timeout and cancellation
- âœ… Extensible command registry for auto-discovery
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (20 unit tests passing, 2 integration tests have known rmcp client issue)

### Upcoming Features
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced documentation and usage examples
- ðŸ”„ Integration and testing with popular IDEs and LLM tools (collaborateion and PRs welcome, open an issue)
- ðŸ”„ RAG documentation to give current API and upstream library API support to the LLM
- ðŸ”„ Monitor filesystem for LLM changes and preemptively update so future commands return faster

## Installation

Under active development, so only from source at the moment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paulirotta/async_cargo_mcp.git
```

## IDE Integration

### VSCode with GitHub Copilot

There are MCP Extensions in the marketplace. They are not necessary and may cause confusion/duplication.

First ensure you have enabled VSCode internal MCP server:

```json
    "chat.mcp.enabled": true
```

```bash
cargo build --release
```

In VSCode either add either as Global or Workplace using 
`CTRL/CMD SHIFT P "MCP: Add Server"`

The result is stored in to `mcp.json` as:
```json
{
    "servers": {
        "async_cargo_mcp": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "YOUR_PROJECT_PATH/async_cargo_mcp/target/release/async_cargo_mcp",
            "args": []
        },
    },
    "inputs": []
}
```

Restart VSCode to activate the MCP server.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`cargo_tools.rs`**: MCP tool implementations for cargo commands
- **`callback_system.rs`**: Async callback infrastructure for progress updates
- **`command_registry.rs`**: Extensible command registration and auto-discovery
- **`operation_monitor.rs`**: Operation lifecycle management and monitoring

### Callback System

Three callback implementations:
- **`NoOpCallbackSender`**: Silent operation (default)
- **`LoggingCallbackSender`**: Logs progress to server console
- **`ChannelCallbackSender`**: Sends updates via async channels

### Operation States

```
Pending â†’ Running â†’ Completed/Failed/Cancelled/TimedOut
```

Each operation tracks:
- Unique ID (UUID)
- Command and description
- Start/end timestamps
- Working directory
- Results and error messages
- Cancellation token

## Testing

Unit and integration tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

A test client is included in the library and used in integration tests

Test cover:
- MCP protocol initialization
- All available cargo commands
- Cargo operations (doc, build, check, add, remove, test, etc.)
- JSON-RPC communication

## Development Notes

**MCP Server Usage Experience**: During development and testing, the async_cargo_mcp server performed efficiently for cargo operations. The clean removal of utility commands (say_hello, echo, sum, increment/decrement/get_value) successfully focused the server on its core purpose of providing cargo command access to LLMs. All cargo operations (build, test, check, doc, add, remove, update, run) work reliably with proper async notifications and error handling.

## Alternatives

The ecosystem is changing rapidly. Running without an MCP tool but adding some prompt incantations might be the most flexible. In some cases a good tool saves time/money.
