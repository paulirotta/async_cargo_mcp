# Product Specification: async_cargo_mcp

## 1. Introduction

`async_cargo_mcp` is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to allow AI assistants to execute Rust's `cargo` commands in a safe, efficient, and asynchronous manner. It acts as a bridge between an AI agent (like GitHub Copilot in VSCode) and the user's Rust development environment.

The primary goals of this project are:

- **✅ Concurrency**: Enable the AI to initiate long-running `cargo` tasks (like `build`, `test`, `clippy`) and continue with other tasks (e.g., planning, writing code, updating documentation) while the `cargo` command runs in the background. This significantly improves the overall task completion speed. **[IMPLEMENTED - Automatic result push system with `--enable-wait` legacy mode]**
- **✅ Performance**: Utilize a pre-warmed shell pool to minimize command startup latency, providing a near-instantaneous feel for `cargo` operations. **[IMPLEMENTED - Shell pool system operational]**
- **✅ Safety**: Provide a structured and validated interface for `cargo` commands, preventing arbitrary shell execution and ensuring operations are confined to the intended working directory. **[IMPLEMENTED - Validated request structures and working directory isolation]**
- **✅ Usability**: Offer clear feedback to the AI through progress notifications and detailed results, including standardized tool hints that guide the AI on how to use the asynchronous features effectively. **[IMPLEMENTED - Professional AI communication with anti-pattern prevention]**
- **✅ Control**: Give the user/operator control over which `cargo` commands are available and how they behave (e.g., synchronous vs. asynchronous execution). **[IMPLEMENTED - CLI flags and tool disabling capabilities]**

This document provides a complete specification of the `async_cargo_mcp` server, including its architecture, communication protocol, command-line interface, and implementation details. **As of August 2025, all core server-side functionality has been implemented and is production-ready.**

## 2. Architecture

The server is built with a modular architecture, with each component having a distinct responsibility.

- **`main.rs` (Server Entry Point)**:

  - Parses command-line arguments using `clap`.
  - Initializes the logging system (`tracing`).
  - Creates and configures the `OperationMonitor` for tracking all tasks.
  - Creates and configures the `ShellPoolManager` for high-performance command execution.
  - Instantiates the `AsyncCargo` service.
  - Starts the MCP server, listening for requests on standard I/O.

- **`cargo_tools.rs` (Core Logic & Tool Router)**:

  - Defines the `AsyncCargo` struct, which holds the state of the service.
  - Uses the `rmcp::tool_router` macro to define all available tools (e.g., `build`, `test`, `add`).
  - Each tool handler function is responsible for:
    1.  Parsing and validating the incoming request parameters.
    2.  Deciding whether to execute the command synchronously or asynchronously based on the `enable_async_notification` parameter and the server's `--synchronous` flag.
    3.  For async operations:
        - Generating a unique `operation_id`.
        - Registering the operation with the `OperationMonitor`.
        - Spawning a background `tokio` task to perform the actual work.
        - Returning an immediate response to the AI with the `operation_id` and a tool hint.
    4.  For sync operations:
        - Executing the command directly.
        - Waiting for the result.
        - Returning the complete result to the AI.
  - Contains the `..._implementation` functions that construct the `cargo` command string from the request parameters and execute it via the `ShellPoolManager`.

- **`shell_pool.rs` (Performance Layer)**:

  - Implements the high-performance shell pooling system.
  - `ShellPoolManager`: Manages a collection of `ShellPool`s, one for each working directory.
  - `ShellPool`: Contains a set of `PrewarmedShell` processes for a specific directory.
  - `PrewarmedShell`: A long-lived `bash` process that is initialized with a JSON-based communication protocol. It can execute commands without the overhead of spawning a new process each time.
  - Includes background tasks for health checking and cleaning up idle shells.

- **`operation_monitor.rs` (State Management)**:

  - Tracks the lifecycle of every operation (`Pending`, `Running`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, `TimedOut`).
  - Stores the results of completed operations so they can be retrieved later by the `wait` command.
  - Handles operation timeouts.
  - Provides a mechanism to cancel running operations.

- **`callback_system.rs` & `mcp_callback.rs` (Communication)**:
  - `callback_system.rs`: Defines a generic `CallbackSender` trait for sending progress updates.
  - `mcp_callback.rs`: Implements the `CallbackSender` trait to send `$/progress` notifications to the MCP client, allowing the AI to receive real-time feedback on running operations.

### Data Flow (Asynchronous Operation)

1.  **AI Client (VSCode)** sends a `call-tool` request (e.g., `build`) to the server via `stdin`.
2.  **`main.rs`** pipes the request to the `AsyncCargo` service.
3.  **`cargo_tools.rs`**'s `build` handler is invoked.
4.  It determines the operation is async, generates `op_build_123`, and registers it with the **`OperationMonitor`**.
5.  It immediately sends a `call-tool` response back to the client with the `operation_id`.
6.  Simultaneously, it spawns a `tokio` task.
7.  The background task requests a shell from the **`ShellPoolManager`** for the specified `working_directory`.
8.  The **`ShellPoolManager`** provides a `PrewarmedShell`.
9.  The task sends the `cargo build ...` command to the shell.
10. The shell executes the command and captures `stdout` and `stderr`.
11. When the command completes, the shell sends the result back to the task.
12. The task calls `complete_operation` on the **`OperationMonitor`**, storing the result.
13. The AI, having received the initial response, continues its work. Later, it sends a `wait` request with `operation_ids: ["op_build_123"]`.
14. The `wait` handler in **`cargo_tools.rs`** calls `wait_for_operation` on the **`OperationMonitor`**.
15. The **`OperationMonitor`** retrieves the stored result for `op_build_123` and returns it.
16. The `wait` handler sends the final, detailed result back to the AI client.

## 3. Communication Protocol (MCP)

The server communicates using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) 2.0](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/mcp/2.0/specification/). All communication happens over `stdin` and `stdout` using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.

### Example: Asynchronous `build` and `wait`

This example shows the full sequence for running `cargo build` asynchronously and then retrieving the result.

**1. Client -> Server: `build` request**

The AI decides to build the project.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "call-tool",
  "params": {
    "name": "build",
    "arguments": {
      "working_directory": "/Users/paul/github/async_cargo_mcp",
      "enable_async_notification": true
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

**2. Server -> Client: `build` response (immediate)**

The server immediately acknowledges the request and provides an `operation_id`.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Build operation op_build_123 started at 14:35:01 in the background.\\n\\n### ASYNC CARGO OPERATION: build (ID: op_build_123)\\n..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

_(The full tool hint is omitted for brevity)_

**3. Server -> Client: Progress Notification (optional)**

While the build is running, the server can send progress updates.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "$/progress",
  "params": {
    "token": "op_build_123",
    "value": {
      "kind": "report",
      "message": "Compiling crate-a v0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Client -> Server: `wait` request**

After performing other actions, the AI is now ready for the build result.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "call-tool",
  "params": {
    "name": "wait",
    "arguments": {
      "operation_ids": ["op_build_123"]
    }
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

**5. Server -> Client: `wait` response (final result)**

The server retrieves the completed operation's result and sends it back.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Wait completed. Longest duration: 5 seconds."
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "OPERATION COMPLETED: 'op_build_123'\\nCommand: cargo build\\nDescription: Building project in the background\\nWorking Directory: /Users/paul/github/async_cargo_mcp\\n\\n=== FULL OUTPUT ===\\n+ Build completed successfully in /Users/paul/github/async_cargo_mcp.\\nOutput:    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.50s"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example: Synchronous `check`

This example shows a synchronous command where the result is returned immediately.

**1. Client -> Server: `check` request**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "call-tool",
  "params": {
    "name": "check",
    "arguments": {
      "working_directory": "/Users/paul/github/async_cargo_mcp"
      // "enable_async_notification" is omitted or false
    }
  },
  "id": 3
}
```

**2. Server -> Client: `check` response (final result)**

The server blocks until `cargo check` completes and returns the full result in one go.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "+ Check completed successfully in /Users/paul/github/async_cargo_mcp.\\nOutput:    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.20s"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Special Case: `nextest` and Early Lock Release

The `nextest` command is known for releasing the `Cargo.lock` file early, before all tests have finished running. The `async_cargo_mcp` server's architecture handles this gracefully.

Because each command runs in its own isolated shell process (managed by the `ShellPool`), one `nextest` operation releasing its lock does not interfere with other pending or subsequent `cargo` commands. If the AI queues `nextest` followed by `clippy`, the `clippy` command will be able to acquire the `cargo` lock as soon as `nextest` releases it, even while the tests themselves are still running to completion in the background. This further enhances the potential for concurrent execution.

## 4. Command Line Interface

The server is configured via command-line arguments.

```
Usage: async_cargo_mcp [OPTIONS]

```

## 5. Implementation Details

- **Language**: Rust
- **Core Framework**: `tokio` for asynchronous I/O and task management.
- **MCP Library**: `rmcp` (official Rust MCP SDK).
- **Argument Parsing**: `clap`.
- **Logging**: `tracing`.
- **Serialization**: `serde` and `serde_json`.

### Key Data Structures

- **`AsyncCargo`**: The main struct holding the server state, including the `OperationMonitor` and `ShellPoolManager`.
- **`OperationInfo`**: A struct in `operation_monitor.rs` that stores all information about a single operation, including its ID, command, state, timings, and result.
- **`PrewarmedShell`**: A struct in `shell_pool.rs` representing a single, persistent shell process. It manages the `stdin` and `stdout` for communication.
- **Request Structs**: Each `cargo` command has a corresponding request struct (e.g., `BuildRequest`, `TestRequest`) defined in `cargo_tools.rs`. These structs use `serde::Deserialize` and `schemars::JsonSchema` to automatically handle request parsing and schema generation for the MCP client.

## 6. Future Plans & Strategic Improvements

### Analysis of AI Concurrency (`Real vs. Desired`)

**Desired State:** The ultimate goal is for the AI to achieve maximum "task parallelism". This means the AI should:

1.  Identify a long-running `cargo` task.
2.  Dispatch it asynchronously.
3.  Immediately pivot to a completely different but productive task that does not depend on the result of the `cargo` command (e.g., writing documentation, refactoring unrelated code, planning the next major step).
4.  Only `wait` for the result at the last possible moment when it's required to proceed.
    The "cargo AND AI active at the same time" percentage should be high, approaching the total duration of the `cargo` tasks.

**Current Reality:** The actual usage pattern observed in many AI models is more sequential, even with the async capability. The AI often does this:

1.  Dispatches an async `cargo` task.
2.  Writes a message like, "Okay, the tests are running. I will now wait for them to complete."
3.  Immediately calls `wait`.

This pattern negates the primary benefit of the asynchronous architecture. The "cargo AND AI active at the same time" percentage is near zero.

**Why does this happen?**

- **Simplicity of State Management:** For an AI, managing a simple, linear sequence of tasks is easier than juggling multiple concurrent operations and their dependencies. Thinking in parallel is a complex cognitive task.
- **Instruction Following:** AIs are trained to follow instructions meticulously. If a user says "run the tests and then fix the bug," the AI interprets this as a strict sequence. The current tool hints, while good, might not be strong enough to override this fundamental behavior.
- **Lack of "Filler" Tasks:** The AI might not have an obvious, independent task to work on while waiting. It might not be instructed to, for example, "write the documentation for function X while the tests for function Y are running."
- **Prompt Engineering:** The prompts given to the AI often imply a sequential workflow. The "Rust Beast Mode" persona helps, but the core user request drives the AI's behavior.

### Systematic Improvements for Concurrency

To bridge the gap between the current and desired state of AI concurrency, a multi-pronged strategy is required, focusing on tooling, AI guidance, and client-side enhancements.

1.  **Server-Side Enhancements & Tooling:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

    - **✅ Default to Pushed Results:** The server's default behavior now pushes final results via `$/progress` notifications. The `wait` tool is treated as a legacy feature for specific use cases, not the primary method for retrieving results.
    - **✅ Optional `wait` Mode:** Added `--enable-wait` server flag. Only when this flag is active does the `wait` tool function. Otherwise, calling `wait` returns a hint explaining that results are pushed automatically, forcing a paradigm shift in AI behavior.
    - **✅ Deprecated `wait` Tool:** The tool's description strongly discourages its use, marking it as a legacy tool for debugging. The primary method for receiving results is the automatic push of final results via `$/progress` notifications.
    - **✅ Status Tool:** Added a lightweight `status` tool that allows the AI to non-blockingly query the state of all ongoing operations (`op_id`, `command`, `status: running/queued`, `runtime`). This provides visibility without forcing a wait, enabling more intelligent planning.
    - **✅ Intelligent "Nudge" Responses:** When `wait` is called soon after an async task starts, the server returns helpful hints about working more efficiently by relying on pushed results.
    - **✅ Concurrency Metrics:** The server tracks the "concurrency gap"—the time between an async call and its corresponding `wait` call. This metric is logged and optionally returned with results to provide feedback on AI parallelization effectiveness.

    **✅ ADDITIONAL: Status Polling Anti-Pattern Prevention**

    During implementation, a critical anti-pattern was identified where AIs repeatedly call the `status` tool instead of using `wait` when they have nothing else to do. This wastes resources and defeats the async system's purpose. The following fixes have been implemented:

    - **Smart Status Call Tracking:** The server tracks consecutive status calls per operation and provides guidance after 3+ repeated calls to the same operation
    - **Professional AI Communication:** Removed all emoticons and human-friendly formatting from AI-facing messages, replacing them with clear, professional text
    - **Intelligent Guidance Messages:** When status polling is detected, the server provides clear instructions to use `wait` with `enable_async_notification=true` instead
    - **Memory Management:** Status call counters are automatically cleaned up when operations complete to prevent memory leaks

2.  **Advanced Prompt Engineering & AI Personas:**

    - **"Concurrent Executor" Persona:** Instruct the AI to adopt a persona focused on minimizing wall-clock time. Key instructions would include: _"Your primary goal is to maximize concurrency. Always look for opportunities to dispatch a `cargo` command and then immediately proceed with unrelated coding, planning, or documentation tasks. You must rely on pushed notifications for results and avoid using the `wait` command unless absolutely necessary."_
    - **Educate on Explicit Prompting:** Guide users to structure their prompts to encourage parallelism. Instead of a sequential "Run tests, then refactor," a better prompt is: "Start the full test suite in the background. While it runs, begin refactoring the `parser::parse` function."

3.  **IDE and Client-Side Enhancements:**

    - **Visual Operation Tracker:** The VS Code client could feature a non-intrusive UI element (e.g., in the status bar) that lists running background operations. This gives both the user and the AI a constant, shared visual context of concurrent tasks.
    - **Actionable Result Notifications:** The client-side integration must ensure that `$/progress` notifications containing final, complete results are clearly presented to the AI model. The format should be unambiguous, allowing the AI to easily parse the result and understand that the specific operation is finished.

## 6.1. Implementation Status Summary ✅

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy workflows preserved through explicit flag activation
4. **Enhanced Visibility**: Status tool provides non-blocking insight into running operations
5. **Metrics-Driven Optimization**: Concurrency tracking enables analysis of AI efficiency patterns

The server implementation phase is **complete and production-ready**. Future enhancements focus on Advanced Prompt Engineering (#2) and IDE/Client-Side improvements (#3).

## 7. Other Suggestions for Improvement

- **Interactive `cargo watch`:** Implement a tool to start `cargo watch` as a long-running background process. The AI could then query its status or view its latest output without needing to `wait` for it to terminate.
- **Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) Support:** Add tools to streamline the process of running a benchmark with PGO, which is a multi-step process that could be abstracted into a single, powerful async tool.
- **Cross-Compilation Management:** Simplify cross-compilation by adding a tool that checks for and installs required `rustup` targets before attempting a `--target` build.
- **Enhanced `cargo add`:** Allow specifying features when adding a new dependency, e.g., `add --name serde --features derive`.
- **Workspace-Wide Commands:** While some commands support `--workspace`, it could be beneficial to have more explicit workspace-level tools that operate on all members of a workspace, perhaps with a selection mechanism.
